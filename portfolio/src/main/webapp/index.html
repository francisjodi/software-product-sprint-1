      <p>Hello there! My name is Julio Valerio! I'm a Computer Science major at Brooklyn College.
         My goals this year are to build an impressive portfolio for future companies and to complete the
         Software Product Sprint program while soaking up as much knowledge and experience as I can! I love 
         electronic music (specifically house and techno), Jiu Jitsu, World of Warcraft, documentaries, and rabbit holes.
         I'm the guy who'll talk your ear off about any technological innovations that could spark the imagination such as:
         Elon Musks Neuralink, the concept of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and they're implications on how
         communities and enterprises are governed, Alpha Go winning chess matches, AI assisting our important decision 
         making processes, the technological solutions to the "tragedy of the commons" for fair resource distribution, 
         Ray Kurzweils take on the Singularity etc. etc.!
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
      <p>I love Thai food! My favorite dish is Summer Rolls with peanut sauce. YUM!</p>
